# ObjectFlow
ObjectFlow is a DFG application framework for embedded computing:
- Data-driven programming for tiny microcontrollers
- Arduino Uno class (2KB/32KB) and larger
- Small library, no central executive, timer- and communication event-driven
- Similar to IEC61499, Node-RED, etc. based on Data Flow Graphs (DFG)
- Uses the LWM2M data model and semantics with an event-driven communication protocol
- Communication is implemented at the application layer using  a set of well-known LWM2M types
