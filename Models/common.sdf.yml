# This definition is a template for ObjectFlow application objects, and is matched with underlying embedded code libraries that implement ObjectFlow on the supported target platforms. 

# Application object types are identified by TypeID and extend this definition by providing resource definitions and the underlying embedded code implementations of the necessary handler types.

# ObjectFLow application nodes are constructed from this template and the application object definitions, and then used to automatically generate the instance graph for the target platform.

# An ObjectFlow application consists of a directed graph of application objects connected by input and output links, which communicate state and time updates.

        description: Copy values from Default Value instances to Default Values in corresponding objects pointed to by Output Link instances, selected by matching Output Link instance numbers with Default value instance numbers. ONly one default value will be selected for each Output Link.

      UpdateCurrentTime:
        description: update the current time value of the CurrentTime resource from a value from a time source and see if the interval has elapsed for the next activation to take place. If the activation time is reached, call the OnInterval Action. if (CurrentTime - LastActivationTime >= IntervalTime) then call OnInterval. This is wrap-around safe and will work as an unconditional trigger if IntervalTime is set at 0 with constant or increasing time value, including all 0 values.

      OnInputSync:
        description: Handler to return the default value to another object in response to SyncFromInputLink. Normalli to would return the Default Value but can be used to retun GPIO pin state, etc.
